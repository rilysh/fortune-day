Someone might raise the objection that it is "circular" to appeal to the Bible
for its own authentication and vindication, meaning that to appeal to Scripture
in support of Scripture is to argue in a circle.  Any court will recognize that
a man has a right to testify in his own behalf.  Now we know that it is possible
for every man to lie, or to deceive, or to be prejudiced.  But because the Bible
is the Word of God, and God, because of Who He is, cannot lie (Titus 1:2),
most certainly the Bible's witness to its inspiration ought, therefore, to be
accepted as trustworthy.

I was on a Boston to New York shuttle flight that gets stuck on the runway
for 3 hours with no explanation.  Worse, I'm sitting in front of three idiot
consultants from Razorfish who spend the whole time talking loudly and incessantly.
Remarkably, not one word of it resembled any productive activity in the slightest.
"So, I conducted a series of group discussion sessions to quantify how they
establish their procedures." "But, Bianca, how did you formulate the framework
for evaluating their paradigms?" I was thinking back to the Slashdot article
where a client sued Razorfish for delivering a shoddy site and wondered whether
these clowns had worked that project.

My favorite line - Bianca is irate because a client asked her for some concrete
bit of information: "Can you believe that? Hello? I'm an Information Architect,
not a Knowledge Engineer!"

Then someone said something about crushing NCSA Mosaic, and I blurted out "Mozilla!"

of the browser.

My opinions about collectivism (socialism, communism, et cetera) were forged
in the fire of 10base2 network hell.  That single cable threading through
everybody's life really showed how fragile an overly interconnected world
would be.  One little mistake --- the choice of solid core instead of tinned
stranded core --- would degrade all lives.  One nervous tic --- someone
shifting a cable or fiddling with a connector --- would cost so much.
When you were using 10base2, you were part of a collective in the purest
meaning of the word.

Imagine a single Twinkie represents all the WTFs ever created in LAMP.
AD would be a Twinkie 35 feet long, weighing approximately 600 pounds.

If you've got 20 years experience but can't build me a linked list
(I don't care that you've never built or even used one --- I'm sure you're
well aware of what it is, and I can describe it nicely for you if you like)
then I'm not interested in hiring you.  Maybe that's unfair, but I need
some way to distinguish between the 800 candidates that applied --- and
the claims they make regarding their experience ain't gonna be my yardstick.
I don't care how many years you've sat in front of a computer, I want to
know that you can help me finish the project I've committed to --- if I
choose to ask stupid questions about how many piano tuners there are in
the world, and you don't like it, than you simply don't want this job
enough --- I want people that want to work for me.  I don't want people
who are going to look elsewhere the second they come across some little task
they don't really want to do.  Finding the right candidate is difficult,
and candidates do often get annoyed at the hoops they have to jump through,
but their reaction to said hoops often gives an insight into their character.
Of course, sometimes we misjudge people, but that's life.  We need to do
something to find our candidate, and believing their claims comes somewhere
near the bottom of the criteria.

Faye: Part of me was hoping you'd tell me I just needed to go out and bang some dude.
Doctor: "Just go out and bang some dude" is one of the phrases you will never hear a psychiatrist say.
  Other such phrases include "I think the heroin is doing you a lot of good," and
  "jesus, no WONDER your mother never loved you."

Learnin' how not to do things is as hard as learning *how* to do them. Harder, maybe.
There'd be a sight more frogs in this world if I didn't know how *not* to turn people into them.

Why even save the BLL when it's passed in?   Why not just call LoadConfig() immediately and save the DTO?

Because no force in the universe, NOT EVEN GOD HIMSELF, will ever convince me that a baby doesn't die
every time someone either directly or indirectly makes a database call in a constructor.

The whole "Fast and Furious" franchise is just one long expensive D&D campaign
